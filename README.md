- JSP
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- Validation
- Sessions

Instructions for using the website:

Three choices from main page:
- Select to view gift by id number 
	-- View by ID is impractical and needs re-worked. I'd like to employ a drop-down menu of names stored.
- Add a Gift to their list of gifts to buy
	-- When clicked, this link brings the user to a form entry
	-- User enters recipient name, gift item, cost, and reason for the gift
	-- When user clicks "Done" button, they are taken to another page and shown the data just entered
	-- From here, the user can return to the "all lists" page
		--- Need to add option for getting back to the home page	
- View all gifts on their list to buy
	-- This link brings the user to the list dashboard of sticky notes
	-- Users can choose to delete or update items from this menu
